## What is Docker?
Docker is a **containerization platform** that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. These containers can run consistently across various environments, eliminating the "it works on my machine" problem.

### Key Features:
- **Isolation**: Containers run independently with their own dependencies.
- **Portability**: Works across different OS and cloud environments.
- **Efficiency**: Uses fewer resources compared to virtual machines.
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale up and manage with orchestration tools.

---

## How Docker Works with the Linux Kernel
Docker utilizes several Linux kernel features to create and manage containers efficiently:

### 1. **Namespaces** (Process Isolation)
Namespaces ensure that each container has its own separate view of the system (e.g., processes, network, filesystem, users). Key namespaces used by Docker:
- `pid` ‚Äì Process isolation
- `net` ‚Äì Separate networking stack
- `mnt` ‚Äì Isolated filesystem mount points
- `uts` ‚Äì Hostname and domain name isolation

### 2. **Cgroups** (Resource Control)
Control Groups (cgroups) allow Docker to limit and allocate resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) to specific containers, ensuring fair resource usage.

### 3. **UnionFS (OverlayFS, AUFS, etc.)**
Union File Systems enable Docker to use a layered approach, making images lightweight and efficient by reusing common layers.

### 4. **Seccomp, AppArmor, SELinux** (Security Controls)
Docker enhances security by enforcing process restrictions and applying security policies.

## Docker CLI, API, Daemon, and Engine

### **1. Docker Engine**
Docker Engine is the core of Docker, responsible for creating and managing containers. It consists of:
- **Docker Daemon (`dockerd`)**: Runs in the background, handling container management.
- **REST API**: Allows external applications to communicate with the daemon.
- **CLI (`docker` command)**: User-friendly interface to interact with Docker.

### **2. Docker Daemon**
The Docker daemon (`dockerd`) runs as a background process and is responsible for managing:
- Containers
- Images
- Networks
- Storage volumes

### **3. Docker CLI**
The Docker Command-Line Interface (CLI) allows users to interact with the Docker Daemon via commands such as:
```sh
# List all running containers
docker ps

# Run a new container
docker run -d nginx

# Stop a container
docker stop <container_id>
```

### **4. Docker API**
The Docker REST API provides a programmatic way to manage Docker resources. Example:
```sh
curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/images/json
```

---

## Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications using a `docker-compose.yml` file.

### **How Docker Compose Works**
Instead of running multiple `docker run` commands manually, Docker Compose automates the process.
Example `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  database:
    image: mariadb
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
```
Run all services using:
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## Project Requirements
The project consists of setting up a small infrastructure with Docker under the following rules:

- Use Docker Compose.
- Each service runs in its dedicated container.
- Build containers from the latest stable version of **Alpine** or **Debian**.
- You must create your own Dockerfiles.
- Prohibited:
  - Pulling ready-made images (except Alpine/Debian).
  - Using `network: host` or `--link`.
  - Running infinite loops (`tail -f`, `sleep infinity`).
  
### **Mandatory Containers:**
- **NGINX** (with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3)
- **WordPress + PHP-FPM** (without NGINX)
- **MariaDB** (without NGINX)
- **Volumes:**
  - WordPress database
  - WordPress files
- **Custom Docker network** (containers must communicate via an internal network)

### **Security Measures:**
- No passwords in Dockerfiles.
- Use environment variables (`.env` file recommended).
- Store credentials securely using Docker secrets.

---

## Bonus Features
- **Redis Cache**: Improve WordPress performance by setting up Redis.
- **FTP Server**: Access WordPress files via FTP.
- **Static Website**: Deploy a simple website (no PHP allowed).
- **Adminer**: Web-based database management tool.
- **Custom Service**: Any additional useful service.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Bonus is evaluated only if the mandatory part is perfect.**

## Mandatory Services
This project requires setting up a small infrastructure composed of different services under specific rules. Each service runs inside its own container, and all containers communicate through a Docker network.

### 1. **NGINX (Web Server with TLS)**
   - **What is NGINX?**
     - NGINX is a high-performance web server, reverse proxy, and load balancer known for its efficiency in handling concurrent connections.
     - It is event-driven and asynchronous, making it more efficient than traditional thread-based web servers like Apache.
   - **How it works:**
     - Handles HTTP and HTTPS requests.
     - Serves static files and proxies dynamic requests to backend servers.
     - Implements TLS encryption for secure communication.

### 2. **WordPress + PHP-FPM**
   - **What is WordPress?**
     - WordPress is an open-source Content Management System (CMS) used for building websites and blogs.
     - It runs on PHP and requires a MySQL/MariaDB database for storing content.
   - **What is PHP-FPM?**
     - PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is an alternative PHP FastCGI implementation that improves performance by handling requests more efficiently.
   - **How it works:**
     - WordPress processes dynamic requests using PHP-FPM, which communicates with the MariaDB database for content storage.
     - PHP-FPM allows PHP scripts to run efficiently by managing worker processes.

### 3. **MariaDB (Database Server)**
   - **What is MariaDB?**
     - MariaDB is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS), developed as a fork of MySQL.
     - It is used to store structured data and efficiently manage SQL queries.
   - **How it works:**
     - Stores all WordPress site data, including user content and settings.
     - Uses SQL for data manipulation and retrieval.
     - Provides authentication and role-based access control.

### 4. **Volumes**
   - **What are Docker Volumes?**
     - Volumes provide persistent storage for data inside Docker containers.
     - Unlike bind mounts, Docker manages volumes, making them more efficient and portable.
   - **How it works:**
     - WordPress files are stored in a volume, ensuring data persists across container restarts.
     - MariaDB stores its database in a volume to retain data across reboots.

### 5. **Docker Network**
   - **What is a Docker Network?**
     - A Docker network enables containers to communicate securely and efficiently.
     - It isolates services from the host system and the internet unless explicitly configured otherwise.
   - **How it works:**
     - Containers communicate via a user-defined bridge network in `docker-compose.yml`.
     - Ensures controlled and secure communication between services.

### 6. **Environment Variables & Security**
   - **What are Environment Variables?**
     - Environment variables store configuration settings, such as database credentials and domain names, without hardcoding them in the source code.
   - **What is Docker Secrets?**
     - Docker Secrets is a secure way to manage sensitive data, such as passwords, without exposing them in files or environment variables.
   - **How it works:**
     - Environment variables are defined in a `.env` file and loaded into containers at runtime.
     - Secrets can be securely stored and managed by Docker, preventing exposure in logs or source control.
